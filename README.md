Hello,
just a simple test for my first repository.  
at this current moment (oct. 1. 2023), I'm learning at HackTheBox Academy and currently 45.55% done with the Information Security Foundations Skill Path, it's also the first path I enrolled with.
I logged into GitHUb at September 23 2023 (UTC time)
Current projects: none
